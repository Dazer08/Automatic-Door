# Automatic-Door
Wrote a simple code in C and implemented it on an Arduino UNO to replicate the opening and closing of an automatic door.
This is a basic project and I hope it helps anyone who has just started exploring their interest in this area.
The components I used are:
1) Arduino UNO
2) Ultrasonic sensor
3) Servo Motor 
4) Jumper Wires
