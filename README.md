# Automatic-Door
Just wrote a simple code and implemented it on an Arduino UNO to replicate the opening and closing of an automatic door.
This is a basic project and I hope it helps anyone who has just started on this venture of interest.
The components I used are:
1) Arduino UNO
2) Ultrasonic sensor
3) Servo Motor 
4) Jumper Wires
